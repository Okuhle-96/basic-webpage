        <h2>Silicon Valley</h2>
        <p>I would like to travel to the Silicon Valley because it is a Tech Hub. 
            It hosts the likes of Facebook, Google and Apple. I would actually like to 
        live there and even work there, lol.</p> 
        <p>
            Most of the technological developments in the world are 
            managed from Silicon Valley. There is also a Computer History Meseum, NASA's
            Research Center and Tech Meseum of Technology.
